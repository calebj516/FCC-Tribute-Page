        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Mr. Lincoln's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>February 12, 1809</strong> - Born near Hodgenville, Kentucky</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1818-19</strong> - Lincoln’s mother dies when he is nine years old. His father remarries the next year, and Abraham gets along well with his stepmother. Neither his father nor his stepmother can read much, but his stepmother encourages him to learn. He is rarely able to attend school, but he loves reading.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1830</strong> - At age 21 Lincoln helps his family move to Illinois by driving their team of oxen on the 200-mile (320-kilometer) trek. In the next years he works splitting rails (in other words, cutting up logs to make fences) and as a postmaster and member of a boat crew.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1832-34</strong> - Lincoln runs for his first political office, in the Illinois state legislature, and loses. He wins election in his second attempt, in 1834, and then wins reelection three times thereafter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1836</strong> - Lincoln becomes a lawyer, taking on cases involving everything from small disputes to murder.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>November 4, 1842</strong> - At age 33, Lincoln marries 23-year-old Mary Todd after a long courtship and a broken engagement. They go on to have four sons, only one of whom lives to adulthood.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1846-49</strong> - Lincoln wins election to the U.S. House of Representatives. During his two-year term, he introduces legislation to end slavery in the District of Columbia.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1854</strong> - The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kansas-Nebraska-Act" target="_blank">Kansas-Nebraska Act</a>, which proposes allowing settlers in Kansas and Nebraska to decide whether they will allow slavery in their territories, brings Lincoln back into politics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1858</strong> - Lincoln runs for the U.S. Senate and holds a series of debates with Senator Stephen A. Douglas. Although Douglas holds on to his Senate seat, Lincoln becomes well-known for his speeches and beliefs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1860</strong> - Lincoln wins the presidency on November 6, defeating three other candidates. Alarm spreads through the Southern states. They fear that Lincoln will abolish slavery. They decide to secede from, or leave, the Union. South Carolina becomes the first state to secede from the Union on December 20.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1861–64</strong> - The American Civil War rages, claiming as many as 850,000 lives from battle and disease. Although the Union has more people and more soldiers, the Confederates win military victories early in the war. Eventually, the Union prevails. Lincoln earns the nickname “The Great Emancipator” for his role in bringing about the emancipation of the slaves. He also wins reelection in 1864.
          </li>
          <li><strong>April 14, 1865</strong> - Pro-slavery advocate John Wilkes Booth shoots Lincoln during a theater performance. Lincoln dies the next morning. “Now he belongs to the ages,” his secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, reportedly says.</li>

            Not often in the story of mankind does a man arrive on earth who is both steel and velvet,
who is as hard as rock and soft as drifting fog, who holds in his heart and mind the paradox
of terrible storm and peace unspeakable and perfect.
